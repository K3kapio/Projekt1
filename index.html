                            <h3>How do we run the orchard?</h3>
                            <p>We run an eco-friendly fruit farm where we specialize in growing apples, strawberries, and cherries. Our farm is committed to using sustainable farming practices that prioritize the health of our soil, water, and surrounding ecosystem. We believe that our commitment to environmentally responsible agriculture not only benefits our customers by providing them with high-quality, flavorful fruit, but also helps to ensure a healthier planet for future generations.</p>

                            <h3>How do we describe healthy food?</h3>
                            <p>In addition to our commitment to sustainable farming, we are also passionate about educating our customers about the importance of eating locally-grown, seasonal produce. We believe that supporting local farmers not only supports the local economy but also helps to reduce the carbon footprint associated with transporting food long distances. By choosing to purchase our fruit, our customers can feel good about supporting a small, family-owned farm while also enjoying the delicious taste of fresh, in-season fruit.</p>
